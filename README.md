### ESP8266 Board.
#

ESP8266 board comes with libraries to communicate over WiFi using TCP and UDP, set up HTTP, mDNS, SSDP, and DNS servers, do OTA updates, use a file system in flash memory, and work with SD cards, servos, SPI and I2C peripherals.

Here's a PDF for Beginners on ESP8266: (https://github.com/AlexTrR/Arduino-ESP8266-IoT/blob/main/Extras/A-Beginner's-Guide-to-the-ESP8266.pdf)


In this project I'll be controllong a relay thay will be connected to a lamp so I can control the light over the internet with any device connected to the WiFi and the board itself will have an algorithm to work randomly.
